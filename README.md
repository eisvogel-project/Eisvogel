# Eisvogel

**Eisvogel** is a tool to calculate the time-domain antenna signal in a radio neutrino experiment.
It uses an electrodynamic Green's function to efficiently propagate radiation through complex environments.

## Key features

- All electrodynamic effects are included: no ray-tracing or geometric optics are assumed
- Supports arbitrary linear, inhomogeneous, anisotropic materials
- Interfaces to CORSIKA 8 to simulate signals from microscopic showers

## Contact us

Eisvogel is still under development. If you want to help, or just learn more about the project, feel free to contact us.

## Installation

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DBUILD_TESTS=ON -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=ON ..
make -j5
```

To also build the components for the calculation of the Green's function do (this requires MEEP to be installed and available)

```
cmake -DBUILD_MEEP=ON ..
```

If you want to build the C++ unit tests, add

```
cmake -DBUILD_TESTS=ON ..
```

## Support for Corsika 8

Eisvogel can interface with Corsika 8. To enable, build Eisvogel as follows

```
cmake -DBUILD_CORSIKA=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/eisvogel-install ..
make -j5
make install
```
